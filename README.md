# Conference Call Bingo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bingo Rules

- A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- You can have multiple bingos

## The challenge

- Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS **respecting the 3 basic rules explained above**.
- The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size.
- **Design your own version** - our game is an example. Be creative and pick your own design!
- Having a bingo requires some **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti – choose something you believe fits best.
- Think of multiple gamers playing the Bingo together.. ensure that winning the game is possible and fair.
- **Add something new.** Come up with something you would enjoy while playing the game.

## Additional Features:

- [x] Ability to change the grid size (small / large)
- [x] Bingo Counter
- [x] Sounds (pop & firework)
- [ ] Mute option

## Additional Packages

- `canvas-confetti` for the confetti explosion
- `styled-components` for dynamic styling
- `material-ui` for speed of development
- `eslint` for code quality & reduced bugs
- `prettier` for code consistency and readability


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
